This paper presents research conducted within the Macroprudential Research Network (MaRs). The network is composed of econo- mists from the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), i.e. the 27 national central banks of the European Union (EU) and the European Central Bank. The objective of MaRs is to develop core conceptual frameworks, models and/or tools supporting macro- prudential supervision in the EU.

The research is carried out in three work streams: 
1) Macro-financial models linking financial stability and the performance of the economy; 
2) Early warning systems and systemic risk indicators;
3) Assessing contagion risks.
